Data Breach? NOT ANYMORE! 

> Just Bin the Doc!

## Abstract
Over the last decade, we have seen a shift in people going from a completely offline mode to a more comfortable online one. Now, whether that be ordering items or working, the internet has transformed itself into a place of work and fun, which has something for everyone. Now, with this transition, all our information is stored online, mostly on third-party websites. That includes our private information, photos, videos, legal paperwork, documents, and what not. This, if hacked, can be misused in the most terrifying way. Our website, DocBin to the rescue. Store all your work in the most secure way that cannot be hacked! Wonder how? Our website is created with the help of blockchain, which ensures that your information is private and can only be unlocked by a private encrypted key known to you. You can also share documents with specific people and need not worry about the documents being accessed by an unknown user. You just need to Bin the Doc!
